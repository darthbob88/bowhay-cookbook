## Strawberry Nutella Ice Cream Cups

### Ingredients

- 1 cup chopped milk chocolate (chocolate chips will work)
- 1/3 cup Nutella
- A few scoops of vanilla ice cream
- Some fresh strawberries
- Melted white chocolate for drizzling on berries if desired

### Preparation

Melt together the chocolate and Nutella. You can dip some strawberries in it and then put them on some parchment paper or something to harden and drizzle them with some white chocolate. Then paint the bottom of about 6 or so cupcake liners with chocolate (you can make more or less depending on how thick you lay on the chocolate).
You don't have to go all the way up the liner. It actually makes it easier to pull the liners off at the end if you don't. Allow the cups to harden (I put it in the freezer) and then paint on another coat so it's nice and sturdy. Once that hardens, fill it with a some ice cream and top that with some strawberry slices. Put them back in the freezer until the ice cream is nice and hard, then spread another coat of the melted chocolate on top (you might have to warm it back up) and immediatly place a chocolate covered strawberry. Keep in the freezer until ready to eat. Be careful when you pull off the liners. Just do it slowly and take your time.
