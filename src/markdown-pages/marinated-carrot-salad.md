## Marinated Carrot Salad

This is a great winter-time salad. I love it! It seems to be an acquired taste with kids, though. I can't find Tomato Bisque soup- just substitute regular tomato.

2 to 4 lbs carrots, sliced diagonally. Cook until tender but firm. Cool.

Place carrots in large bowl. Add:

* 2 to 4 stalks of celery, cut in thin diagonal strips.

* 1 green pepper, thinly sliced

* 1 red onion thinly sliced.

To make marinade combine the following in blender:

* 1 can tomato bisque soup

* 1 cup sugar

* 3/4 cup vinegar

* 1 tsp salt

* 1/2 tsp pepper

* 1 tbsp Worcestershire sauce

* 1/2 cup salad oil

Blend until well mixed, pour over sliced vegetables, and marinate overnight.<br />
Serves 12-20 and keeps in refrigerator for 2 weeks.<br />
Save marinade for use as salad dressing.
